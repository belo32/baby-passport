# Baby Passport
This project was started in 2014 to keep track of information related to new born babies.  It allowed any user to keep track of the baby's feeding and diaper change times.  The hospital originally provided us with a document to do all the tracking and had decided to digitize it into a mobile app.

The code has been moved over from my private repo to public.  I've also migrated over the project to Android Studio since it was originally written in Eclipse.  Unfortunately, I could only get it to run in the VM but any code related to persisting data is still not functional.  Either way I still wanted to make it public for anyone who wanted to use it.  I will eventually update the persistence code and fix any issues.

Everything in the project was written with Native Android libraries.

Note: if you cannot see any commit history, it's on purpose because originally I had committed the keystore files into the repo.
